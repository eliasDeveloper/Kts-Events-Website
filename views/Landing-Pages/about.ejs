					<h2>Something About Us</h2>
					<p class="f-para">There are several ways people can make money online. From selling products to
						advertising. In this article I am going to explain the concept of contextual advertising.
					</p>
					<p>First I will explain what contextual advertising is. Contextual advertising means the
						advertising of products on a website according to the content the page is displaying. For
						example if the content of a website was information on a Ford truck then the advertisements
						would be for Ford trucks for sale, or Ford servicing etc. It picks up the words on the page
						and displays ads that are similar to those words. Then when someone either performs an
						action or clicks on your page you will get paid.</p>

					<h3>The 2019 Conference</h3>
					<p>When I first got into the online advertising business, I was looking for the magical
						combination that would put my website into the top search engine rankings, catapult me to
						the forefront of the minds or individuals looking to buy my product, and generally make me
						rich beyond my wildest dreams! After succeeding in the business for this long, I’m able to
						look back on my old self with this kind of thinking and shake my head. </p>
